# Data Visualization Web Dashboard

This project is a data visualization web dashboard that allows users to plot mock data from four different time-series datasets, including temperature, pressure, distilled oxygen, and pH. The dashboard is built using Python Flask, Plotly, Docker, Javascript, and AJAX, and connects to a PostgreSQL database to retrieve the data.

## Features

- Real-time data visualization: The web dashboard provides users with real-time visualization of data from the four different time-series datasets, allowing for quick and efficient data analysis.
- User-friendly interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users without a technical background.
- Interactive data plotting: The dashboard allows users to interact with the data, including zooming in and out and selecting specific time periods.
